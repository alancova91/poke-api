Pokemon Finder on React JS, using PokeApi.

The goal is to search the pokemon you want, and bring elemental information as:

- Sprite
- Pokedex NÂ°
- Type or types
- Weaknesses
- Effectiveness.

This information is fetched using different endpoints on PokeApi and combining themselves because a pokemon could have two different types, and that means more effective or weaker to different types of pokemons. 

This finder is ideal for people who play Pokemon videogames and can't remember all Pokemon types and their efficacy.
