Pokemon Finder on React JS, using PokeApi.

The goal is to search the pokemon you want, and bring elemental information as:

- Sprite
- Pokedex NÂ°
- Type or types
- Weaknesses
- Effectiveness.

This information is fetched using different endpoints on PokeApi and combining themselves because a pokemon could have two different types, and that means more effective or weak to different types of pokemons.
